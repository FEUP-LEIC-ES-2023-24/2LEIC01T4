## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

Start by defining a clear and concise vision for your app, to help members of the team, contributors, and users into focusing their often disparate views into a concise, visual, and short textual form. It provides a "high concept" of the product for marketers, developers, and managers.

A product vision describes the essential of the product and sets the direction to where a product is headed, and what the product will deliver in the future. 

**We favor a catchy and concise statement, ideally one sentence.**

We suggest you use the product vision template described in the following link:
* [How To Create A Convincing Product Vision To Guide Your Team, by uxstudioteam.com](https://uxstudioteam.com/ux-blog/product-vision/)

### Features and Assumptions
Indicate an  initial/tentative list of high-level features - high-level capabilities or desired services of the system that are necessary to deliver benefits to the users.
 - Feature XPTO - a few words to briefly describe the feature
 - Feature ABCD - ...
...

Optionally, indicate an initial/tentative list of assumptions that you are doing about the app and dependencies of the app to other systems.

### Elevator Pitch
Draft a small text to help you quickly introduce and describe your product in a short time (lift travel time ~90 seconds) and a few words (~800 characters), a technique usually known as elevator pitch.

Take a look at the following links to learn some techniques:
* [Crafting an Elevator Pitch](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/elevator-pitch.htm)

* [Top 7 Killer Elevator Pitch Examples, by toggl.com](https://blog.toggl.com/elevator-pitch-examples/)


## Requirements

In this section, you should describe all kinds of requirements for your module: functional and non-functional requirements.

## Architecture and Design

### Logical architecture
The Frontend Application component is responsible for user interface functionalities, while the Backend Services handle business logic and interact with the database. Additionally, the Backend Services facilitate communication with the Rating and Review System to manage user feedback and with the Reporting Service to handle reports of undesirable behavior.

### Physical architecture
User's Device: Represents the user's mobile device running the mobile app.
Application Server: Hosts both the frontend and backend components of the application, including the database.
Database Server: Represents the server hosting the database, responsible for storing and managing persistent data required by the application.
Communication flows from the mobile app to the frontend application hosted on the Application Server. The frontend application interacts with the backend services also hosted on the Application Server. The backend services communicate bidirectionally with the Database Server for data storage and retrieval operations.

## Project management
Software project management is the art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

In the context of ESOF, we recommend each team to adopt a set of project management practices and tools capable of registering tasks, assigning tasks to team members, adding estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track their projects.

Common practices of managing iterative software development are: backlog management, release management, estimation, iteration planning, iteration development, acceptance tests, and retrospectives.

You can find below information and references related with the project management in our team: 

* Backlog management: Product backlog and Sprint backlog in a [Github Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2023-24/projects/64);
* Release management: [v0](#), v1, v2, v3, ...;
* Sprint planning and retrospectives: 
  * plans: screenshots of Github Projects board at begin and end of each iteration;
  * retrospectives: meeting notes in a document in the repository;
